# #Difference between list and tuple is we can not change tuple

# #Creating a tuple using ()
# t=(1,4,7,5,3)

# t0=() #empty tuple

# # t1=(1) #this is the wrong way of making tuple with single element 
# t1=(1,) #tuple with single element

# #Printing the elements of a tuple
# print(t[0])

# #Cannot update the values of a tuple
# # t[0]=34
